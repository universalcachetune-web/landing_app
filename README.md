# Unified Cache Optimizer Website

A modern, responsive website showcasing the Unified Cache Optimizer project - a revolutionary system that provides unified caching for database services and KV cache for Large Language Models with intelligent query optimization.

## Features

- **Unified Caching Layer**: Seamlessly integrates database caching with LLM KV caching
- **Database Service Integration**: Optimized for SQL, NoSQL, and time-series databases
- **LLM KV Cache**: Dedicated key-value caching for Large Language Model operations
- **Query Optimization**: Intelligent query planning and execution optimization
- **Real-time Analytics**: Comprehensive monitoring and performance metrics
- **Enterprise Security**: Built-in encryption and compliance features

## Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Flask (Python)
- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript
- **Styling**: Modern CSS with gradients and animations
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach

## Installation

1. **Clone or navigate to the project directory**:
   ```bash
   cd unified-cache-website
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Set up email configuration (optional)**:
   ```bash
   # Copy the example environment file
   cp .env.example .env

   # Edit the .env file and add your Gmail App Password
   # Follow the instructions in .env.example for setting up Gmail App Password
   ```

4. **Run the Flask application**:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

5. **Open your browser** and navigate to:
   ```
   http://localhost:8000
   ```

## API Endpoints

The Flask backend provides several API endpoints:

- `GET /` - Main website
- `GET /api/features` - Features data
- `GET /api/performance` - Performance metrics
- `POST /api/contact` - Contact form handling
- `GET /health` - Health check endpoint

## Development

The website is designed to work both as a static site and with the Flask backend. When running with Flask, it can dynamically load content from the API endpoints. If the API is not available, it gracefully falls back to static content.

## Deployment

### Local Development
```bash
python app.py
```

### Production Deployment
For production deployment, consider using:
- Gunicorn as WSGI server
- Nginx as reverse proxy
- Docker containerization

Example with Gunicorn:
```bash
pip install gunicorn
gunicorn -w 4 -b 0.0.0.0:8000 app:app
```
